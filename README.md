## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


With the lead up to the official release of Angular 2, some parts of the framework have been in flux. One of these is routing: the Angular 2 router has been completely replaced in the lead up to the final release. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to use the new Angular 2 Router in your apps. You'll see how to configure basic routing to static pages, how to extract parameters from the route path and how to make your routing modular. You'll also see how user access control can be implemented with the Angular 2 router.
